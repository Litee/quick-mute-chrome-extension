# "Quick Mute" Chrome extension

## Features

* Click extension icon to switch between three modes: no mute, mute all tabs and "mute all tabs except the current one"

## How to install

1. Clone extension to your machine - e.g. `git clone https://github.com/Litee/quick-mute-chrome-extension.git`
1. Look into `background.js` and `manifest.json`. It is always a good idea to check that code does not do anything suspicious and does not have too many permissions ;)
1. Open chrome://extensions tab in your Chrome browser
1. Activate developer mode (required for next step)
1. Install extension as unpacked

Ping me if you liked this extension and I may consider publishing it into Chrome Web Store.
